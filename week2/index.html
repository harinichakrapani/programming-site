<p id="souls"> C.S. Friedman's 'A Feast of Souls' is unusual. While it does trumpet fantasy's overdone trope- the rise of a hero to save us from extinction- it also refreshingly breaks the mold. Discarding the gimmicky wand, staff or Latinized chant to 'sell' magic to the reader, instead providing a canon that proclaims the soul energy or 'athra' as the fuel for magic. Indeed, drawing power from within is a spiritual experience for the reader and characters driven into Friedman's world, urging us all in its wake to contemplate questions about identity and morality since using athra can shorten one's life.  

Agonizing early on is the primary heroine Kamala. Born sensitive to the athra, she is 'gifted,' yet a scarred child abused by lecherous men for years. Magic is within her, but she needs a sorcerer to learn how to use it. As expected, the training overwhelms her; not just the physical exertion of conjuring but the mental dissonance.

Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom's protective Wall. To the south, the king's powers are failing-his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king's new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.

The Gothic Story: Introduction to "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "Ligeia"

These stories represent the highest achievements in the literary genre of the gothic horror story. By gothic, one means that the author emphasizes the grotesque, the mysterious, the desolate, the horrible, the ghostly, and, ultimately, the abject fear that can be aroused in either the reader or in the viewer. Almost everyone is familiar with such characters as Dr. Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula, two of today's pop culture horror characters who evolve from the gothic tradition, and it is probably not an exaggeration to say that most adults in the Western world have been exposed to some type of gothic tale or ghost story. We all know that a gothic story or a ghost story will often have a setting that will be in an old, decaying mansion far out in a desolate countryside; the castle will be filled with cobwebs, strange noises, bats, and an abundance of secret panels and corridors, down which persecuted virgins might be running and screaming in terror. This is standard fare; we have either read about such places or seen them in the movies or on TV. The haunted castle is a classic setting of the gothic story. The author uses every literary trick possible to give us eerie sensations or to make us jump if we hear an unexpected noise. The shadows seem menacing in these stories, there are trap doors to swallow us up, and the underground passages are smelly, slimy, and foul- all these effects are created for one reason: to give us a sense of the ghostly and the supernatural.

Both "Ligeia" and "The Fall of the House of Usher" utilize many of these aspects of the gothic and are considered by critics to be not just among Poe's best short stories, but also among the finest examples of the gothic genre in all of literature.

<h2><figurecaption> The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri  </figurecaption>

 <p id="dante"> 
 Written by the Italian Alighieri between 1308 and his death in 1321, this epic poem follows the author's journey through the afterlife over the course of three installments: Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso.  The allegory for the human soulâ€™s journey toward God through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven has inspired countless artists over the centuries, from composers and sculptors to video game designers and filmmakers.  However, most of the films only reference Alighieri's work or re-imagine it in a contemporary setting rather than adapting the work with respect to the time period it was written in.  I'm surprised that no major studio has signed on for the adaptation since it comes as a pre-packaged trilogy.

Professor Aronnax, his faithful servant, Conseil, and the Canadian harpooner, Ned Land, begin an extremely hazardous voyage to rid the seas of a little-known and terrifying sea monster. However, the "monster" turns out to be a giant submarine, commanded by the mysterious Captain Nemo, by whom they are soon held captive. So begins not only one of the great adventure classics by Jules Verne, the 'Father of Science Fiction', but also a truly fantastic voyage from the lost city of Atlantis to the South Pole.

<p id="wimpy"> 

It's a new school year, and Greg Heffley finds himself thrust into middle school, where undersized weaklings share the hallways with kids who are taller, meaner, and already shaving. The hazards of growing up before you're ready are uniquely revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary.

In book one of this debut series, Greg is happy to have Rowley, his sidekick, along for the ride. But when Rowley's star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend's newfound popularity to his own advantage, kicking off a chain of events that will test their friendship in hilarious fashion.

Author/illustrator Jeff Kinney recalls the growing pains of school life and introduces a new kind of hero who epitomizes the challenges of being a kid. As Greg says in his diary, "Just don't expect me to be all 'Dear Diary' this and 'Dear Diary' that." Luckily for us, what Greg Heffley says he won't do and what he actually does are two very different things.
